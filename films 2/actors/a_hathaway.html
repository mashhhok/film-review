               <p class="description_column">Anne Jacqueline Hathaway (born November 12, 1982) is an American actress. The recipient of various accolades, 
                  including an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Primetime Emmy Award, she was among the world's highest-paid actresses in 2015. 
                  Her films have grossed over $6.8 billion worldwide, and she appeared on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list in 2009.</p>
               <p class="description_column">Hathaway graduated from Millburn High School in New Jersey, where she performed in several plays. 
                  As a teenager, she was cast in the television series Get Real (1999–2000) and made her breakthrough as the protagonist in her debut film, 
                  the Disney comedy The Princess Diaries (2001). After starring in a string of unsuccessful family films, Hathaway made a transition to adult 
                  roles with the 2005 dramas Havoc and Brokeback Mountain. The comedy-drama The Devil Wears Prada (2006), in which she played an assistant 
                  to a fashion magazine editor, was her biggest commercial success to that point. She played a recovering addict with a mental illness in 
                  the drama Rachel Getting Married (2008), which earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.</p>
               <p class="description_column">Hathaway went on to star in the commercially successful romances Bride Wars (2009), 
                  Valentine's Day (2010), and Love & Other Drugs (2010), and the fantasy film Alice in Wonderland (2010). In 2012, 
                  she starred as Selina Kyle / Catwoman in her highest-grossing film, The Dark Knight Rises, which served as the final installment 
                  in The Dark Knight trilogy. Also that year, she played Fantine, a prostitute dying of tuberculosis, in the musical romantic drama 
                  Les Misérables, for which she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She then played a scientist in the science fiction 
                  film Interstellar (2014), the owner of an online fashion site in the comedy The Intern (2015), a haughty actress in the heist film 
                  Ocean's 8 (2018), a con artist in the comedy The Hustle (2019), and Rebekah Neumann in the miniseries WeCrashed (2022).</p>
               <p class="description_column">In addition to film roles, Hathaway has won a Primetime Emmy Award for her voice role in the sitcom The Simpsons, sung for soundtracks, 
                  appeared on stage, and hosted events. She supports several charitable causes. She is a board member of the Lollipop Theatre Network, 
                  an organization that brings films to children in hospitals, and advocates for gender equality as a UN Women goodwill ambassador. 
                  Married to actor and businessman Adam Shulman, she has two sons with him.</p>
