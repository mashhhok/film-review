               <p class="description_column">Matthew David McConaughey is an American actor. He had his breakout role with a supporting performance in the coming-of-age comedy Dazed and Confused (1993).
                  After a number of supporting roles, his first success as a leading man came in the legal drama A Time to Kill (1996). His career progressed with lead roles in the science fiction 
                  film Contact (1997), the historical drama Amistad (1997), and the war film U-571 (2000).</p>
               <p class="description_column">In the 2000s, McConaughey became known for starring in romantic comedies, such as The Wedding Planner (2001), How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003), 
                  Failure to Launch (2006), Fool's Gold (2008), and Ghosts of Girlfriends Past (2009), establishing him as a sex symbol. After a two-year hiatus from film acting, McConaughey 
                  began to appear in more dramatic roles beginning with the legal drama The Lincoln Lawyer (2011). He gained wider praise in 2012 for his performances as a stripper in Magic 
                  Mike and a fugitive in Mud.</p>
               <p class="description_column">McConaughey's portrayal of Ron Woodroof, a cowboy diagnosed with AIDS, in the biopic Dallas Buyers Club (2013) earned him widespread praise and 
                  numerous accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Actor. He followed it with a supporting role in The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), and a starring role as Rust Cohle 
                  in the first season of HBO's crime anthology series True Detective (2014), for which he was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. 
                  His subsequent film roles earned varying degrees of commercial and critical success, with his most notable releases being Interstellar (2014) and The Gentlemen (2019), as well 
                  as voice work in Kubo and the Two Strings (2016), and the Sing film series (2016-2021).</p>
