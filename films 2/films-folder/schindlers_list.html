               <p class="description_column">Schindler's List is a 1993 American historical drama film directed and produced by Steven Spielberg 
                  and written by Steven Zaillian. It is based on the 1982 non-fiction novel Schindler's Ark by Australian novelist Thomas Keneally. 
                  The film follows Oskar Schindler, a German industrialist who saved more than a thousand mostly Polish-Jewish refugees from the 
                  Holocaust by employing them in his factories during World War II. It stars Liam Neeson as Schindler, Ralph Fiennes as SS officer Amon Göth, 
                  and Ben Kingsley as Schindler's Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern..</p>

               <p class="description_column">Ideas for a film about the Schindlerjuden (Schindler Jews) were proposed as early as 1963. Poldek Pfefferberg, 
                  one of the Schindlerjuden, made it his life's mission to tell Schindler's story. Spielberg became interested when executive Sidney Sheinberg 
                  sent him a book review of Schindler's Ark. Universal Pictures bought the rights to the novel, but Spielberg, unsure if he was ready to make 
                  a film about the Holocaust, tried to pass the project to several directors before deciding to direct it.</p>
               
               <p class="description_column">Principal photography took place in Kraków, Poland, over 72 days in 1993. Spielberg shot in black and white 
                  and approached the film as a documentary. Cinematographer Janusz Kamiński wanted to create a sense of timelessness. John Williams 
                  composed the score, and violinist Itzhak Perlman performed the main theme.</p>

               <p class="description_column">Schindler's List premiered on November 30, 1993, in Washington, D.C. and was released on December 15, 1993, in the United States. 
                  Often listed among the greatest films ever made, the film received universal critical acclaim for its tone, acting (especially Fiennes, Kingsley, and Neeson), 
                  atmosphere, and Spielberg's direction; it was also a box office success, earning $322 million worldwide on a $22 million budget. It was nominated for twelve Academy Awards, 
                  and won seven, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Original Score. The film won numerous other awards, including seven BAFTAs and three 
                  Golden Globe Awards. In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked Schindler's List 8th on its list of the 100 best American films of all time. The film was designated as 
                  "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant" by the Library of Congress in 2004 and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.</p>
