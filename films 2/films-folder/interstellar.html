               <p class="description_column">Interstellar is a 2014 epic science fiction film co-written, directed and produced by Christopher Nolan. 
               It stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, Matt Damon, and Michael Caine. 
               Set in a dystopian future where humanity is struggling to survive, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through 
               a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new home for mankind.</p>

               <p class="description_column">Brothers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan wrote the screenplay, which had its origins in a script Jonathan developed in 2007. 
               Christopher produced Interstellar with his wife, Emma Thomas, through their production company Syncopy, 
               and with Lynda Obst through Lynda Obst Productions. Caltech theoretical physicist and 2017 Nobel laureate in Physics 
               Kip Thorne was an executive producer, acted as scientific consultant, and wrote a tie-in book, The Science of Interstellar. 
               Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros. Pictures, and Legendary Pictures co-financed the film. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot 
               it on 35 mm in the Panavision anamorphic format and IMAX 70 mm. Principal photography began in late 2013 and took place in Alberta, 
               Iceland and Los Angeles. Interstellar uses extensive practical and miniature effects and the company Double Negative created additional digital effects.</p>
               
               <p class="description_column">Interstellar premiered on October 26, 2014, in Los Angeles, California. In the United States, it was first released on film stock, 
               expanding to venues using digital projectors. The film had a worldwide gross of over $677 million (and $701 million with subsequent re-releases), 
               making it the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2014. It received positive reviews for its screenplay, direction, themes, visual effects, musical score,
               acting, and ambition. It has also received praise from many in the science community for its scientific accuracy and portrayal of theoretical astrophysics. 
               Interstellar was nominated for five awards at the 87th Academy Awards, winning Best Visual Effects, and received numerous accolades.</p>
